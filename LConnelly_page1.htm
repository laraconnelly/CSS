		<h2>Recover Tunes From Your iPod</h2>
		<p class="greyText">Someday the hard drive on your computer will crash, stranding thousands of songs on your <span class="lowerI">i</span>Pod. Here's how to get them back onto your PC or Mac.</p>		
		<ol id="tunesOL">
			<li>
				<p><span class="boldText">Reinstall <span class="lowerI">i</span>Tunes.</span> Launch the app and sign in to your itunes music Store account. Don't plug in your <span class="lowerI">i</span>Pod yet.</p>
			</li>
			<li>	
				<p><span class="boldText">Install and launch</span> a free trial of PodUtil from KennettNet software (www.kennettnet.co.uk). The app will sit there idling, displaying a Waiting-for-<span class="lowerI">i</span>Pods message.</p>
			</li>
			<li>				
				<p><span class="boldText">Plug in your <span class="lowerI">i</span>Pod.</span> PodUtil will detect it and display a window that shows the files and playlists on your <span class="lowerI">i</span>pod. Click the "Choose" button at the bottom of Pod-Util and select your <span class="lowerI">i</span>Tunes music folder. Next, click the "Copy Settings" button. In the dialog box that appears, select both "Add Tracks to <span class="lowerI">i</span>Tunes" and "Rebuild Playlists." Click "OK."</p>
			</li>
			<li>				
				<p><span class="boldText">Read the Don't-Steal-Music warning</span> in the lower right corner of PodUtil. Think carefully. Click the "Copy" button below it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>				
				<p><span class="boldText">Watch as PodUtil copies</span> your songs, videos, playlists, and podcasts back to your computer and then loads them into <span class="lowerI">i</span>Tunes. Reauthorize your <span class="lowerI">i</span>Tunes music store tracks. Done!</p>

		<p>&rarr; <span class="boldText">Match Beats //</span> When mixing two songs, you need to match their speeds. Do this by concentrating on the snare drum: its crisp, distinctive rhythm will help you recognize which song needs to speed up and which needs to slow down. Adjust the tempo of one of the songs until the two are in sync.</p>

		<h1>Make a Playlist</h1>
		<p class="greyText">The iTunes playlist function makes everyone a DJ. But crafting the perfect soundtrack takes more finesse than just piling a bunch of songs together. <span class="blackText">DJ Qbert</span>, two-time winner of the DMC world DJ championships, drops some science on the art of the mix.</p>

		<ol id="djTips_OL">
				<li class="djTips_OL_left">
					<p>Even Paris Hilton needs a few drinks before she's ready for a dance-off, so your playlist should start off mellow and slowly board the soul train. Figure two hours before you raise the roof.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="djTips_OL_left">
					<p>Soundtracks, like conversations, can be jarring without transitions. Don't attempt to pair Air with Quiet Riot unless you're a professional DJ. Look for songs that complement each other.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="djTips_OL_right">
					<p>Dead space between tracks is for amateurs. Since the iPod can't crossfade, use ProTools to merge tunes into a single song file. If you can match beats, even better.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="djTips_OL_right">
					<p>Be sure to include a few hits. Everyone loves listening to hip new music, but every now and then you gotta get the party moving with an old classic - even if the party's just you.</p>
